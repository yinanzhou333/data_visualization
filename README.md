The QS World University Rankings, published annually by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) and endorsed by the International Ranking Expert Group (IREG), serve as a benchmark for assessing global university performance.

This project offers a comprehensive analysis through an interactive dashboard interface, focusing on key metrics and comparisons between public and private universities globally. 
By leveraging interactive visualizations and data-driven insights, the dashboard provides a nuanced understanding of academic performance, physical attributes, educational resources, and global appeal across different regions. 
A year filter is used to enable analysis across different years.
